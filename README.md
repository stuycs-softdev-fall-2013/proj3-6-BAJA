Background
----------

You are a programmer. This morning you signed up for an email account and soon
after received a job offer; you're excited to get started. But be careful,
because you're about to get sucked into a deadly world of trickery and
espionage.

Plot
----

* You recieve a simple job offer that you quickly complete.
* You do a couple of follow up jobs.
* You discover that you hav hacked the government! You want out.
* They black mail you; you have no choice. You have to keep working for them.
* Eventually you hack them, and escape the world of danger.

So every mission you have will fit into the plot above, but will also be a
coding and hacking puzzle. This is a game of danger, deceit, and learning.

Puzzle Ideas
------------

1. Someone emails you saying that he's friends with Mike Zamansky; Z referred
   you to him as a capable programmer, and he wants to hire you for a job. You
   are to hack into his son's school's grade server so he can pass a failing
   class needed to graduate. The login password is hidden in the HTML source
   (it's pretty easy). You update the grade, email him back, the server checks
   the update happened, and then replies with thanks and a new offer.

2. "I think my wife is cheating on me. Can you crack her email and get me some
   information?" You hack into her email, which is another account on the same
   email server, and find emails from a suspicious individual that are
   encrypted with a relatively simple cypher. You reply with the encrypted
   code - he thanks you, but gives you no further job offers.

3. You are stumped, so you try to decrypt the code yourself. It's a simple
   substitution cypher. It turns out that his "wife" is actually a government
   agent and you have stumbled on potentially illegal information. You reply
   saying that you have discovered the true meaning of the code and that you
   are confused/upset he gave you a malicious task. He replies saying that you
   passed the "test", which was to see if you could decrypt the code on your
   own - and now that you have hacked into a government agent's email, he
   blackmails you into completing further missions for him (lest you be
   reported to the authorities for hacking).

Running
-------

You will need Flask and Gunicorn. Start the project with `python main.py` and
then navigate to http://localhost:8000.
