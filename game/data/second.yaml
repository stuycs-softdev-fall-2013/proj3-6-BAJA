Dear {%name},

    Nice job, I appreciate the help. If you're still looking for work, I could use you help with another issue I'm having. I think my wife is cheating on me. If you could break into her email - {%email} - I would be very thankful. You should be looking for a message from someone named "Bill Donovan." Don't worry about the message, she's very paranoid and encrypts her emails. I don't need you to crack the code though. I think I know her well enough to be able to solve it. Forward the email to me.

Thanks,

John Black
