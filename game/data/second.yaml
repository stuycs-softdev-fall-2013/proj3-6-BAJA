    Dear {%name},

        Nice job, I appreciate the help. If you're still looking for work, I could use you help with another issue I'm having. I think my wife is cheating on me. If you could break into her email - {%email} - I would be very thankful. You should be looking for a message from someone named "Bill Donovan." Don't worry about the message, she's very paranoid and encrypts her emails. I don't need you to crack the code though. I think I know her well enough to be able to solve it. Forward the email to me.

    Thanks,

    John Black

        Are you sure that's my wifes email and not someone else's? Because that's not what I'm looking for. Get back to me when you have what I'm looking for.
