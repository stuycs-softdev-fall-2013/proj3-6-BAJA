        Dear {name},
        Nice job, I appreciate the help. If you're still looking for work, I could use your help for another issue I'm having. I think my wife is cheating on me. If you could break into her email, {email}, I would be very thankful. You should be looking for a message from someone named "Bill Donovan." Don't worry about the message, she's very paranoid and encrypts her emails. I don't need you to crack the code though. I think I know her well enough to be able to solve it. Copy the code and send it to me as a reply to this email.
        Thanks,<br>Jon

        Are you sure that's the right code? It doesn't look right. Get back to me when you have what I'm looking for.
        Jon
