    Dear {%name},

        Hey. My good friend Mike Zamansky endorsed you as a good programmer. I would be interested in hiring you. My son is in danger of failing out his school and I can't have that happen. The school website is {%link}. If you could change his math grade from a 60 to an 85 you would be compensated generously.

    Thanks,

    John Black
