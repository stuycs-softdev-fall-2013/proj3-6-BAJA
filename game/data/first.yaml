        Dear {%name},

            Hey. My good friend Mike Zamansky endorsed you as a good programmer. I would be interested in hiring you. My son is in danger of failing out his school and I can't have that happen. The school website is {%link}. If you could change his math grade from a 60 to an 85 you would be compensated generously.

        Thanks,

        John Black

            I didn't see my son's grades change. Maybe you can try again?

        Thanks,

        John Black
